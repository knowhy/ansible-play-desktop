Ansible Desktop role
====================

Ansible roles to deploy my desktop machines.

Overview
--------

In this repository I store my Ansible roles to deploy my desktop machines.

I'm using ArchLinux and I have a very minimalistic setup centered around Emacs. I'm using Emacs, conkeror as browser, mupdf for pdfs, mpv and mpd for media and ratpoison as WM to switch between Emacs and conkeror/mupdf/mpv.

Current state
-------------

I'm currently deploying my first machine solely with Ansible and this repository is subject to change a lot.
